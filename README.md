### Development Script (`npm run dev`)

This script is used to start the server in development mode with the following features:

1. **`nodemon`**: Automatically restarts the application when any file is modified, improving development workflow.
2. **`-r dotenv/config`**: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file into `process.env` automatically.
4. **`src/index.js`**: The entry point of the application where the server is initialized and started.

To run the script, use `npm run dev`.
